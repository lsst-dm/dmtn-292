In order to address the challenges of the Rubin Science Platform, Rubin developed a kubernetes-based approach to service deployment with an in-house service configuration and support infrastructure called phalanx, based on ArgoCD.
It became apparent that the challenges of running a service-oriented architecture in a modern observatory summit lent themselves equally well to this approach.
In this paper we will describe how phalanx was adapted for use for telescope, instrument and sensor control services and the advantages of providing a unified service infrastructure for both control systems and data services.
